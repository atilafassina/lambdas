## Disclaimer ⚠️

This is a monorepo with all one-off lambda functions I have created. Some are powering up data for other projects, others are for lessons or screencasts, and some are even just random experimentations. Each has their own readme with a **quick-deploy** to the platform I built them for. In their specific Readmes you will also find information on environment variables and any other relevant details.
